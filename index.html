        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello! I'm Gorla Sunil Kumar, a recent graduate with a degree in
          Electronics and Communication Engineering (ECE) and a budding web
          developer.I am proficient in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Bootstrap, and
          have been exploring frameworks like React to expand my skill
          set.Additionally, I have experience with SQL, MongoDB, and Django for
          backend development.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          In addition to web development, I have completed a DevOps course where
          I gained hands-on experience with tools such as Jenkins, Git & GitHub,
          Ansible, Terraform, and AWS Cloud. I also completed a Salesforce Admin
          course, which has equipped me with the skills to manage and customize
          Salesforce environments effectively.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Although I am at the beginning of my professional career, I am highly
          motivated and eager to apply my technical knowledge to create dynamic
          and responsive websites, as well as to leverage DevOps and Salesforce
          tools to improve development workflows and customer relationship
          management. My enthusiasm for technology drives me to continuously
          learn and stay updated with the latest trends in web development,
          DevOps practices, and Salesforce administration. In my free time, I
          enjoy learning new courses and exploring new technologies to further
          enhance my skill set. I am excited to bring my problem-solving skills
          and passion for technology to collaborative and challenging
          environments.
